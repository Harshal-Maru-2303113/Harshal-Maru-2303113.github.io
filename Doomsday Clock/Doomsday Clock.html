                        <p>The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic representation of the likelihood of a global catastrophe,
                            especially from nuclear war or climate change. It was created in 1947 by the Bulletin of the
                            Atomic Scientists, a group of scientists and experts concerned about the dangers posed by
                            nuclear weapons. The clock's hands are set to represent how close the world is to a
                            potential global catastrophe, with midnight representing the hypothetical "doomsday."</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>The time on the clock is not determined by any precise scientific formula but is rather set
                            by the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, in consultation with a Board of Sponsors that
                            includes prominent scientists and intellectuals. The decision to move the clock's hands
                            closer to or further from midnight is based on factors such as geopolitical tensions, the
                            proliferation of nuclear weapons, climate change, and other global threats.</p><br>

                        <p> The Doomsday Clock has been adjusted numerous times since its inception, reflecting changes
                            in global circumstances and the perceived level of risk. It serves as a reminder of the
                            urgent need for action to address the existential threats facing humanity and has become an
                            iconic symbol of the precarious state of the world.</p><br>

                            <p>Here's a detailed timeline of the Doomsday Clock's changes:</p> <br>
                            <p><b>1945: </b> The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is founded by scientists who had
                                worked on the Manhattan Project, including renowned physicists such as Albert Einstein
                                and Robert Oppenheimer. The organization's mission is to engage the public and
                                policymakers on issues related to nuclear weapons, arms control, and global security.
                            </p><br>
                            <p><b>1947: </b> Just two years after the end of World War II and the bombings of Hiroshima
                                and Nagasaki, the Bulletin introduced the concept of the Doomsday Clock. The idea
                                originated from a group of scientists who were part of the Bulletin's leadership,
                                including physicist Eugene Rabinowitch. The clock was designed as a symbolic
                                representation of the world's vulnerability to catastrophic destruction, particularly
                                from nuclear war. Its hands were set to represent how close humanity was to potential
                                global catastrophe, with midnight symbolizing the hypothetical "doomsday."<br>
                                <span style="padding-left: 6%;">Initially, the clock was set at seven minutes to
                                    midnight. This setting reflected the perceived level of danger posed by nuclear
                                    weapons and the potential for a global nuclear conflict amid escalating Cold War
                                    tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The setting was not
                                    determined by any precise scientific formula but rather by the collective judgment
                                    of the Bulletin's scientists and experts.</span>

                                reason for the change was the first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union, in August
                                1949, which marked the beginning of the world’s nuclear arms race
                                In 1953, United States and Soviet Union successfully tests their first hydrogen bombs
                                which heightened the risk from nuclear weapons which further escalates the conditions of
                                ARM RACE , this results in the advancement of Doomsday clock to 2 minutes to midnight.

                            <p><b>1960: </b> It was set back to seven minutes to midnight because international
                                negotiations (“spirit of Camp David”) were taking place in Geneva between U.S. President
                                Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to end nuclear testing ,
                                reflecting in temporary ease of tensions.</p><br>

                            <p><b>1963: </b> It was set back farther, to 12 minutes to midnight, after the Soviet Union,
                                the United Kingdom, and the United States signed the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which
                                banned nuclear testing in Earth’s atmosphere, outer space, and underwater.
                                1968: United Nation involvement in Vietnam intensifies, India and Pakistan battle in
                                1965, Isreal and its arab neighbors renews hostilities in 1967 and development of
                                nuclear weapons in France and China in order to stand as a global players. This all
                                events makes the Doomsday clock to move back to 7 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                the treaty’s other signatories develop nuclear power if they promise not to produce
                                weapons. This results in the set back of Doomsday Clock to 10 minutes to midnight.</p>
                            <br>

                            <p><b>1972: </b> The United States and Soviet Union sign two treaties. The Strategic Arms
                                Limitation Treaty (SALT) limits the number of ballistic missile launchers either country
                                can possess. The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty seeks to stop a race for weapons
                                designed to shoot down an adversary’s incoming nuclear missiles. This helps to further
                                shift the clock backward to 12 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                appear to be modernizing their nuclear forces, not reducing them. This things makes the

                                the United States and Soviet Union have been behaving like ‘nucleoholics’ and the
                                inability of international institutions to contain political crises move the hands of
                                the clock forward to 7 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                            <p><b>1984: </b> As US-Soviet relations starts declining, The United States threatens to
                                provoke a new arms race by seeking a space-based anti-ballistic missile system,
                                prompting the Doomsday Clock to be set at 3 minutes to midnight.
                                1991: The clock was reset to 17 minutes to midnight, its farthest from doomsday thus
                                far. The decision came after the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)
                                by the Soviet Union and the United States, which was an agreement designed to reduce the
                                nuclear weapons arsenals of both countries.</p><br>

                                its own tests only three weeks later. Russia and the United States continue to serve as
                                poor examples to the rest of the world, with a combined total of more than 7,000 weapons
                                aimed at each other and ready to launch within 15 minutes. This led clock to shift to 9

                        The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic representation of how close humanity is to a global
                        catastrophe, especially from nuclear war or other existential threats. The Bulletin of the
                        Atomic Scientists, which manages the clock, considers a range of factors when adjusting its
                        time, including:
                        <ul><br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Nuclear Weapons:</b> The primary factor since the clock's inception has been the
                                presence and proliferation of nuclear weapons. Escalating tensions between nuclear-armed
                                states, advancements in nuclear technology, or the potential for accidental or
                                deliberate use of nuclear weapons can influence the clock's time. Some major incidents
                                are listed below:
                                <ol style="padding-left: 4%;"><br>
                                    <li><b>Cuban Missile Crisis (1962):</b> This was a direct confrontation between the
                                        United States and the Soviet Union over the presence of Soviet ballistic
                                        missiles in Cuba. The crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war and
                                        is considered one of the closest moments to nuclear conflict during the Cold
                                        War.</li><br>

                                        Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union. There were concerns about the
                                        potential use of nuclear weapons during this conflict.</li><br>
                                    <li><b>Suez Crisis (1956):</b> This crisis involved Israel, France, the United
                                        Kingdom, and Egypt over control of the Suez Canal. There were fears that the
                                        conflict could draw in the United States and the Soviet Union, potentially
                                        leading to a nuclear confrontation.</li>

                                environment is increasingly considered. Factors such as rising sea levels, extreme
                                weather events, and disruptions to food and water supplies can contribute to instability
                                and conflict, thus influencing the clock's time. Nevertheless, here are some major past
                                climate change events that have influenced global consciousness and could indirectly

                                        periodically releases comprehensive assessments of climate change, summarizing
                                        the latest scientific understanding of the issue. These reports, which began in
                                        1988, provide policymakers and the public with crucial information about the
                                        impacts of climate change and the urgency of taking action. While the clock
                                        itself doesn't directly respond to IPCC reports, they contribute to the broader

                                        by nearly every country in the world, the agreement aims to limit global warming
                                        to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement's

                                            millions of people worldwide to demand urgent action on climate change.
                                            These protests raise awareness about the severity of the climate crisis and
                                            put pressure on governments and institutions to take meaningful steps to
                                            address it. While not events in the traditional sense, these movements shape
                                            public discourse and political responses to climate change, which could

                                        awareness about the dangers of hazardous waste disposal and led to the
                                        development of environmental regulations in the United States.</li><br>

                                        Soviet Union. A reactor explosion released significant amounts of radioactive
                                        material into the atmosphere, resulting in widespread contamination of the
                                        surrounding area and beyond. The disaster had severe environmental, health, and

                                            frequent and intense wildfires in recent years, primarily due to
                                            deforestation, land clearing, and climate change. These fires not only
                                            contribute to carbon emissions and climate change but also destroy critical

                                            accelerated melting in recent decades due to rising temperatures and climate
                                            change. The melting of the ice sheet contributes to sea-level rise, leading
                                            to coastal erosion, flooding, and threats to communities and ecosystems

                                            catastrophic shrinkage due to excessive water diversion for irrigation
                                            projects. This diversion, primarily for cotton farming, has caused the sea
                                            to lose over 90% of its volume since the 1960s, leading to severe

                        Everyone on Earth has an interest in reducing the likelihood of global catastrophe from nuclear
                        weapons, climate change, advances in the life sciences, disruptive technologies, and the
                        widespread corruption of the world’s information ecosystem. These threats, singularly and as
                        they interact, are of such a character and magnitude that no one nation or leader can bring them
                        under control. That is the task of leaders and nations working together in the shared belief
                        that common threats demand common action. As the first step, and despite their profound
                        disagreements, three of the world’s leading powers—the United States, China, and Russia—should
                        commence serious dialogue about each of the global threats outlined here. At the highest levels,
                        these three countries need to take responsibility for the existential danger the world now
                        faces. They have the capacity to pull the world back from the brink of catastrophe. They should
                        do so, with clarity and courage, and without delay.

                                to destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making. It is a metaphor,
                                a reminder of the perils we must address if we are to survive on the planet.<br><br>
                                When the Doomsday Clock was created in 1947, the greatest danger to humanity came from
                                nuclear weapons, in particular from the prospect that the United States and the Soviet
                                Union were headed for a nuclear arms race. The Bulletin considered possible catastrophic

                                as a magazine rather than a newsletter. Martyl—as she was known professionally—was
                                married to a physicist, Alexander Langsdorf, who worked on the Manhattan Project at the
                                University of Chicago.

                                At first, the artist considered using the symbol for uranium. But as she listened to the
                                scientists who had worked on the Bomb, as they passionately debated the consequences of
                                the new technology and their responsibility to inform the public, she felt their sense
                                of urgency. So she sketched a clock to suggest that we didn’t have much time left to get
                                atomic weapons under control.

                                international disarmament movement, he was in constant conversation with scientists and
                                experts within and outside governments in many parts of the world. Based on these
                                discussions, he decided where the clock hand should be set and explained his thinking in
                                the Bulletin’s pages.

                                When Rabinowitch died in 1973, the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board took over the

                                clock as necessary. The board is made up of scientists and other experts with deep
                                knowledge of nuclear technology and climate science, who often provide expert advice to
                                governments and international agencies. They consult widely with their colleagues across
                                a range of disciplines and also seek the views of the Bulletin’s Board of Sponsors,

                                dioxide in the atmosphere, the degree of acidity in our oceans, and the rate of sea
                                level rise. The board also takes account of leaders’ and citizens’ efforts to reduce
                                dangers, and efforts by institutions—whether of governments, markets, or civil society
                                organizations—to follow through on negotiated agreements.

                                The Bulletin is a bit like a doctor making a diagnosis. We look at data, as physicians
                                look at lab tests and x-rays, and also take harder-to-quantify factors into account, as
                                physicians do when talking with patients and family members. We consider as many
                                symptoms, measurements, and circumstances as we can. Then we come to a judgment that
                                sums up what could happen if leaders and citizens don’t take action to treat the
                                conditions.<br>

                                destroy civilization also exists. Such a calamity has not occurred because national
                                leaders have so far heeded warnings, and because at critical times in the past 78 years,
                                they have set up communication channels with adversaries, negotiated treaties to control
                                the weapons, taken steps to radically reduce arsenals, and engaged erstwhile enemies in
                                cooperative projects. Preventing nuclear war requires continued diplomacy, more
                                exchanges of information, and open communications that engender trust.

                                Likewise, as long as Earth’s climate continues to change, we are at risk of suffering
                                the potential consequences, in particular disruptions in the environment—such as
                                extended droughts, changes in growing seasons, sea level rise, and fisheries

                                contribute to climate change; we know how they work, so presumably we can find ways to
                                reduce or eliminate the harm. But we need concerted cooperation worldwide to prevent

                            <div id="faq13">Each of these threats has the potential to destroy civilization and render
                                the Earth largely uninhabitable by human beings. They are also intertwined: Some
                                advocate for more nuclear power to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but increasing the
                                number of nuclear reactors, and the amount of enriched uranium and plutonium required
                                for their operation, would also increase the risk of spreading nuclear weapons.
                                Likewise, if we don’t reduce emissions, some natural resources, like fresh water, could
                                become more scarce, leading to conflicts that might spiral into war and the possible use
                                of nuclear weapons.

                                We can’t afford to address one threat without addressing the other. And in fact, the

                                seem to be outside our daily experience and beyond our control, but we all have a stake
                                in avoiding untimely death. We want to live our lives free from destruction by nuclear
                                weapons and from the growing scarcity of natural resources brought about by a warming
                                planet. These interests in survival should motivate us to learn as much as we can about
                                the powerful technologies that could destroy our way of life.
                                <br><br>
                                Second, share what you’ve learned with others—in your family, workplace, church, school,
                                or social media feeds. The more we talk to each other about what matters most—surviving
                                and flourishing—the more confidence we’ll have about expressing our interests.

                                Third, tell your government representatives that you don’t want even more of your tax
                                money spent on nuclear weapons or on subsidizing carbon dioxide-producing fossil fuel
                                technologies. Write letters, tell them at town hall meetings, email their offices, and
                                let them know that your security depends on getting rid of nuclear weapons and on
                                finding ways to keep our planet habitable for humanity.<br>
